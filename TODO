LEARNINGS
----------
* Debugging in XCODE: always focuse on the actual errors not warnings when failing build
* React-native link replacings manual linking and pod install
* Navigation in react native is difficult... there are lots of options
* Android - make sure all Build tools specifices in build.gradle match...
* FacebookSDK -- using LoginBehavior in order to let people reset their password, needs to be different for each platform
