* Start using git
* Figure out how to run both ios and android at once
* Better Eng Design + Roadmap (what functionality do I need before moving to design?)

* Handling errors with mealfetch and all actions!
* Ordering of feed
* Staying logged in
* Spinner for when photo is being captured?
* Choose photo from library
* Edit meal photo
* Look up open source react native projects for good design...
	* Add button on the bottom right
* Push meal flow ontop of feed vs. slide?
* Try with iPhone
* Request permissions (Android) programmatically (React Native, PermissionsAndroid)

* Handling login errors: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/errors
* Security of download URL for firebase storage?


10/27
--------

10/25
--------

10/24

10/23

X Finish adding react-native-camera...
X Figure out flow for when photo is captured? What does the state need to be?


10/22
-----------
X Create landing page

QUESTIONS
------------
* Is add "multiDexEnabled true" to app/build.gradle under defaultConfig bad?
* Why not call action creater directly? As opposed to passing through props?


LEARNINGS
----------
* Debugging in XCODE: always focuse on the actual errors not warnings when failing build
* react-native link replacings manual linking and pod install
